#Very simple javascript physics engine#
*Version 0.1*

This is my way of learning javascript. Use it as you like, if you find a use for any of it.

*Current Functionality:*

- Round "particles" with simple vector movement with ability to:
  - Bounce
  
  Can be affected by:
      - Gravity
      - Drag/air-resistance
      - Elasticity (in material)
      - Other particles
      
**TODO**
- Differently shaped objects



**CHANGELOG**
*v.0.1.1*
- Removed vector class
- rewrote 'vector'-code
- Added collisions
- Added variable-settings through html
