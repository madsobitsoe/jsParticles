#Very simple javascript physics engine#
*Version 0.1*

This is my way of learning javascript. Use it as you like, if you find a use for any of it.

*Current Functionality:*

- Round "particles" with simple vector movement with ability to:
  - Bounce
  
  Can be affected by:
      - Gravity
      - Drag/air-resistance
      - Elasticity (in material)

**TODO**
- Particles with different mass
- Differently shaped objects
- Collisions
